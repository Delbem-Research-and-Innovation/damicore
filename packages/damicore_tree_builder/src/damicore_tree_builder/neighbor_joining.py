# Two Q scores closer than this, relative to the magnitude of the better one, are one tie
# for the lexicographic rule to break.
#
# An exact float64 comparison asserts a precision the input never had: every distance here is
# a ratio of integer compressed sizes, so its meaningful digits run out long before the
# 16th. Worse, the ties the rule exists to break are precisely the ones rounding destroys --
# with four clusters left, Q(i,j) and Q(k,l) for complementary pairs are algebraically equal
# for *every* matrix, yet float64 detects that only about 60% of the time, and no summation
# strategy fixes it because the cancellation happens in the final subtraction rather than in
# the sums. A relative band restores the rule and makes the choice stable across platforms.
