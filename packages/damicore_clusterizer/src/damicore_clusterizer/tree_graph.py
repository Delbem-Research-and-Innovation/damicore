    """Map branch lengths onto the strictly positive edge weights FastGreedy is given.

    A shorter branch joins a closer pair, so the weight is the reciprocal of the length. The
    reciprocals are then translated so the smallest is exactly one, and that translation is
    the point of this function: modularity is a weighted sum, so a single unbounded weight
    would decide the partition by itself, and a reciprocal is unbounded as the length
    approaches zero. Translating here rather than on the lengths keeps the ratio between
    weights bounded by the spread of the data.

    It also settles what a negative branch means. Neighbor Joining emits one where the matrix
    contradicts the split it is making, and the reciprocal of a negative length sorts below
    every positive one, so such a branch becomes the weakest edge rather than the strongest.

    The result is at least one everywhere and is unchanged by rescaling every length.
